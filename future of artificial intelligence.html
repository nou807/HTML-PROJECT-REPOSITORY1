<h1>Future of artificial intelligence</h1>
<h2>The future is uncertain UNKNOWN.</h2>
<h3>Investigators seem to disagree on many of the same issues. To the extent that technology improves it is reasonable to believe that AI will continue to grow more and more.</h3>
<h3>But we can think of two different types of the future of A.I. Of course</h3>
<h3>1) Positive vision </h3>
<h3>2) Negative vision </h3>
<h3>➤Positive imagination of Future Maybe, the day is not long when we will just sit back in our comfy beds and simply order our robots to make up for the damage. He will be the perfect friend for us. Just enjoy Technology.</h3>
<h3>➤Negative imagination of Future Can End in Another Way. One day there will be a knock on our door. As we open it, we will see a large number of robots entering our house destroying everything we have and looting it.
 This is because there has always been an advantage in Technology, attracting conflicting interests. The same is true of robots. Because now they will have complete power to think like a human being, or as anti-social forces. 
 Therefore, we must think twice before enabling Cognition.</h3>
