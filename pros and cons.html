<h1>Pros and Cons</h1>
<h2>Pros of AI</h2>
<h2>1. The 'err' is human, so why not use AI?</h2>
<h3>The machine has decided based on past data records. With algorithms, the chances of errors are reduced. This is a success, as solving complex problems requires complex calculations that can be done without error. Business organizations use digital assistants to communicate with their users, which helps them save enough time. Demand for consumer businesses is achievable so they don't have to wait. They are designed to provide the best possible user experience.
For example - the Hell of Mars Orbiter Mission, or the Mission Mangal movie, based? How do they reach such heights? The first reason is the human brain and the second is artificial intelligence. There is no space for an artificial error. Robots are provided with information sent to explore the area. Metal bodies are more resistant and have greater strength to withstand space and hostility. They are made and used in such a way that they cannot be changed or destroyed or deteriorated in a human environment.</h3>

<h2>2. AI is not tired and easy to wear</h2>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence and the science of robots are used in mines and other petrol testing processes. These sophisticated machines help explore the ocean floor and overcome human limitations. Thanks to a robotic system, he can do the hard work with extra effort and responsibility. Moreover, they do not wear off easily.</h3>

<h2>3. Digital help aids in everyday activities</h2>
<h3>Siri listens and does the work with one tap. GPS helps you navigate the world. How can I forget the basic need? Food, clothing, accommodation, and a smartphone. They are the ones that predict what we will type, in short, they know us better than anyone else. The best part, is understanding what you are trying to say and presenting the sentence in the best possible way. Have you noticed that when you post a picture on social media, you're tagging people, but the machine automatically detects people's faces and tags those people. The same is true when working on Google Photos. By default, a folder is created for people with the help of their faces. Artificial Intelligence is widely used by financial institutions and banking institutions because it helps organize and manage information. Also, detecting fraud is using artificial intelligence based on smart cards.</h3>
<h2>Cons of AI</h2>
<h2>1. Higher cost</h2>
<h3>It is true that AI comes with a higher cost, but there is no such thing as a free lunch. It costs a lot of money as it is a complex machine. Besides the cost of installation, its repairs and repairs also require huge costs. Software systems require general development and address the needs of a changing environment.
Also, in the event of a crack, the cost of procurement is very high. Thus, recovery requires a great deal of time.</h3>

<h2>2. No human replication</h2>
<h3>No matter how smart the machine is, it will never be human. The machines are reasonable though, they are very inhuman as they have no feelings and moral standards. They do not know what is right and what is lawful and because of this, they do not have their own ability to execute judgment. They do what they are told to do and therefore the judgment of right or wrong is not for them. If they encounter a situation that we can see in them they are acting incorrectly or otherwise postpone in such cases.</h3>

<h2>3. No improvement in experience</h2>
<h3>Construction creativity will not be enhanced by experience, they can do the same work and if they are not given a different instruction. Over time, it can lead to wear and tear. It saves a lot of data but the way it can be acquired and used is very different from human intelligence.
Also, they cannot deal with a dynamic environment and therefore cannot change their responses to changing circumstances. We are constantly bombarded with the question of whether it is fun to replace humans with machines.
Artificial intelligence has no feelings and as a result there is no such thing as whole-heartedness or absolute love. It makes no sense of being alone or of unity or personal touch. They couldn't tell the difference between a hard worker and a poor worker.</h3>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>All that is said, the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence are evaluated, by the student, the user and their perspective. AI and robots will improve the way we think, the way we explore new horizons, whether in space or at sea. As the age statement goes, the need is the mother of all innovation, and so is AI. People know what they need and they are getting better at explaining what they want and turning this into a reality. In the near future, things will happen so fast that we will see significant changes and new inventions. Hold your breath the Mega breakdown has begun!</h3>
